## The Book of Africans, Chapter 3

I have looked at all aspects of the current situation with respect to Africa, and the countries of the continent of Africa, including its deep wound bared by African-descendant, immigrants, and supporters, this deep moral, economic, and cultural scar left by colonialism and slavery. There is this feeling that most African descendant knows because, at some point in their life, one is subject to racism or has to confront condescending terms born from the association of skin color, your status as a child or grandchild of someone that has immigrated, the blatant defeat of your ancestors, therefore, one will not completely feel at home. And you wouldn't naturally feel this way, the environment, due to occasional reminders, made you develop this feeling, despite the natural rejection like antibodies, because, naturally, you want to belong. Even worse, this is not exclusive to Africans, but also Caribbeans, African-Americans, and native Africans that are emigrating for better conditions are also targeted here.

But absolute clarity and definitive resolution came when I realized that, if you observe it from a purely rational and absolutely logical perspective, the way you consider racism or react to it, or the images and messages that you hear from other cultures, which are often synonyms of lack of wealth, not only physical wealth but also the lack of knowledge wealth and mental resource, which result in these induced ideas and tacit knowledge about Africa, Africans, Afro-descendant and the African Diaspora, is just the natural product of the dumbness of people thinking this because these ideas are the only knowledge displayed on mainstream free mass media such as television, ads, social media, books, teachers and parents and the product of « still winning ».
The imbalance is still present, yet this balance isn’t what is sought because balance is perceived as one population is winning while the other one is loosing, binary thinking falsified by a closed perception of the ecosystem.

This enlightenment is born from facts: some people from Africa suffers because of the cascade of consequences that resulted from the era of colonialism, such as rerouting of resources to other cultures, like taxes, and multiple disruptions in term of the stability of democracies and political systems, often the result of special ops and external military warfare, overarching governance of the financial system (CFA franc, WEF, Central Bank System)  has not permitted African and afro-descendent to establish the building blocks of a civilization growth. In addition, the growth is slowing down: the progression encounters external and internal roadblocks, in an ever-changing worldwide development and mutations. And this ever-changing world is the answer to answer to everything: the competition can favor Africa at each and every moment because the competition is actually perpetual: there is no winner, but you would be winning in a continuous manner. It is not about winning at the expense of other cultures losing, but winning within your people, winning for yourself.

The first chapter was written when African countries were at the pinnacle of world civilizations, I am thinking about Ethiopia, Namibia, Mali, Egyptians, Arab kingdoms, Congo, etc.

The second chapter occurred during the age of colonialism.

The following is the Masterplan for the third chapter and the perpetual win.

## Prerequisites

First, before this strategy is discussed, each and everyone should ask in his deeper self, if is there such a thing as an African nation, moreover is there something you, as an individual, are willing to build? If the answer is yes, then know that only invested time and actions matter, even though it is a small and one-time action. Each individual is a unit of the African Nation, and the African Nation has no meaning, no existence without the people. And each individual has the occasion and the power to make a difference.

Second, in modern times, we are used to hearing "the pen is mightier than a sword". But do not be fooled, African nations, even if they were shining by their culture, peace, simplicity, artistic beauty, musical and dancing depth, folklore, spirituality, and order, they have been crushed by the greater military forces of Europe. This power has permitted to enforce of cultural transformation, enslavement, forced relocation, resources appropriation, culture erasure and replacement, social structure disqualification, and the consideration of a master owning the most powerful and capable tool, just like a biological machine selected for its potency, and disposed of, to not say killed otherwise, having the status and the utility between the horse and the worst human of the western civilization. It is important to see it with a cold and open eye without bad feelings, such as anger, hate, resentment, or sorrow.
Nowadays, most of us have not experienced slavery, hence we must keep our heads cool, and focus our analytical power on the plan that lies ahead. And, from this great suffering, great nations such as the United States of America, or the Caribbean island have emerged, and their development has permitted to deliver great advances for humanity, along with the creation of new cultures, languages, and artistic styles.

The foundational principle is that there is no end game, it is a perpetual game, and it is about to thrive at each second.

## Preparing the Masterplan

What a nation should do:

- Set and agree on a vision
- Establish a new blueprint of Nation Social-Economic Architecture. Begin with an ideal in mind.
- Get the foundations right before investing massively in the next stage of technology evolution. It does not mean that Africans should not invest, but the focus should be on foundations for ensuring a perpetual movement
- Set a system of supervision and super-change
- Individual Agreements, Collective Direction
- Have transparency and regular communication with reports(data oriented) to the nation in all common shared systems 
- Establishment and Renewal of Elites in each discipline
- Corpus for each domain, focused on a specific discipline, that pushes each discipline and industry toward a winning state
- Adopt organic growth, i.e. grow from a solid foundation, based on people's needs, at each cycle of growth, with a pace of growth that is chosen and planned by its people
- Embrace the cultural differences by adopting the axiom: "and" multiplies, "or" divides.
- Nation, as universal, and non-temporal is greater than countries.
- And countries are the ground upon which we root the past, construct the present and we design future
- Set and Agree on a Masterplan and enrich it with the details on a continuous basis.
- Set, decide, and manage your own objectives, according to your own values, within your own limits
- Promote Technology for fairness in life, the abundance of fundamentals, and the growth of civilization
- Set Africa as a ground economical neutral zone (0 fees/taxes between countries, even for individuals investing/buying/consuming African products and resources from African soil or companies), with no global government, but super observatories/super corpora)
- Cultures are the is like the blood vessels linking Africans and Afro-descendants together through space and time, but also enable them to relate with other humans. Nurture your culture, and learn from it, remember it, and develop it. And each individual is defining your culture. display your language, clothes, literature, architecture style, music, art, dance, thought opinion, fields of research, history, etc.
- Buy, eat, wear, and transform African products and services. Refine them, discuss them, promote them, politely criticize them to help them to improve them, invest in them, finance them, secure them, to make them simply better, for the benefit of everyone. It is utterly important that people from the nation consume what the nation produces to ensure the economic engine keeps working and we do not introduce critical weaknesses by relying too much upon other nations[^1].
[^1]:Refer to the status of Europeans impacted by the significant increase of the costs of oil and gas prices during the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2022).
- Grow and promote the values that are shared by many to iron the basic structure of our civilization: the family. This is part of the foundation building blocks. Setting aside the practices that are exceptionally meaningless in term of statistics, data, and facts are of utmost importance. Each parent has a critical role in the contribution of the education of children, their elevation, and their definition of their identity as each parent acts as a model. And what happens at the atomic level of the family in terms of values, behavior, commitment, courage, integrity, accountability, oriented toward mental and physical strength in the pursuit of the Good for life, for your loved ones, for your community, and your nation happens in a global scale of a nation.
- Women, promote the basic beauty and the new beauty standard without wearing artifacts from other women from other nations as if without hairs from other ethnics region made you complete: you are already complete. Define your beauty standards and style.
- Profit first from your kind before selling or giving your resources to the outside world. Use, study, and research what earth is giving you: there is a lot of use and discovery from the soil.
- Eat what you grow, use what you transform, repurpose what you waste, store what you will need, give to the good, leave no kind behind, expulse harmers
- Crave for knowledge and know-how. Acquire information and practice from everyone and from all nations, share it across the African nation, the give the experience and the development acquired back to the entire world. No matter what, the development will be correlated with the capacity of work choreography and the management of natural resources.
- Work not in timelines, but in frequencies
- The perpetual win must not be at the expense of other peoples and living beings of Earth, no initiative must be taken in that respect.

## 1. Set and agree on a vision

The vision must be precisely described (take the time to shape it, perfect it),  overwhelmingly simple in its message so that even a kid can understand it, and, finally, free from any form of interpretation. Thus:

- We strive for abundance in all aspects
- Everybody has enough food
- Everybody must Feel secure
- Everybody is trained to defend oneself or defend someone in need.
- Have somewhere to live and can own
- Have guaranteed utility water, electricity, waste disposal, internet, transportation, computation, social administration services
- Every person owns seat at the social table, and a vote as a representation of unitary, equal in weight, and irrevocable decision power.
- Grow a culture of service from the genuine and sincere dedication 
- Everybody has a job. It must be a constitutional right and obligation at the same time. This is crucial that all the production, organizational, healing, defensive, and innovation power are used to their fullest potential.
- Support to find one’s mission. Actively help those who feel lost.
- Access to indisputable properties acquired honestly
- Crave for freedom of speech in respect of others' dignity and privacy.
- Punish heavily malevolent behaviors[^2], especially the ones harming family structure, harming kids, and treasons concerning the African nation (even more for self-interest), and make the punishment as clear, just, logic, and unbias as possible
[^2]: Behaviors working against the life and the prosperity of African and the African nations
- Teach everything in a civil contract regularly.
- Make the vote a right and an obligation for everyone.
- Promote spiritual development and seek for developing appealing activities as public free service. (Peace of Soul, Peace of Mind, Peace of heart, Peace Around)
- We seek and crave the Truth. Only the truth creates a united reality, there is no alternate reality born from lies and deception. The truth set the unshakable foundation, even when it hurt. Truth minimizes pain, and bad moments are unavoidable. Truth from bad experience yields to experience and learning, the building blocks of wisdom. Truth builds mental strength.
